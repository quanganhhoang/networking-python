LAB 3 - UDP

Step 1: Capture a Trace

Step 2: Inspect the Trace
NOTE: Wireshark gives the name of the application protocol, 
not the (UDP) transport protocol unless Wireshark cannot determine the application protocol.

Source Port: port from which UDP message is sent
Destination Port: port number and possibly name to which UDP message is destined
Length: length of UDP message
Checksum: checksum over the message that is used to validate its contents

Step 3: UDP Message Structure
1. Sketch a figure of the UDP message observed
See attached [udp-structure.png]

2. What does the Length field include? The UDP payload, UDP payload and UDP header, or UDP payload, UDP header, and lower layer headers?
The Length field includes UDP payload and UDP header.

3. How long in bits is the UDP checksum?
16 bits

4. How long in bytes is the entire UDP header?
8 bytes

Step 4: UDP Usage

1. Give the value of the IP Protocol field that identifies the upper layer protocol as UDP.
Next header: UDP

See attached [udp-packet.png]

2. Examine the UDP messages and give the destination IP addresses that are used when your com-puter is neither the source IP address nor the destination IP address.
(If you have only your com-puter as the source or destination IP address then you may use the supplied trace.)

Example of destination IP address: 224.0.0.251
See attached [MDNS-ip-multicast.png]

3. What is the typical size of UDP messages in your trace?
8 bytes
