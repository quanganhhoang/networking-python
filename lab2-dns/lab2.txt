A. NOTE:

dig is a flexible, command-line tool for querying remote DNS servers that replaces the older nslookup program.

B. Lab:

Step 1: Manual Name Resolution

1. dig @198.41.0.4 www.mit.edu
-> sends a request to a nameserver at given ip address for the given domain nameserver

a.edu-servers.net.	172800	IN	A	192.5.6.30

2. dig @192.5.6.30 www.mit.edu

;; AUTHORITY SECTION:
mit.edu.		172800	IN	NS	usw2.akam.net.
mit.edu.		172800	IN	NS	asia1.akam.net.

mit.edu.		172800	IN	NS	eur5.akam.net.
mit.edu.		172800	IN	NS	use5.akam.net.

3. dig @usw2.akam.net. www.mit.edu

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.mit.edu.		1800	IN	CNAME	www.mit.edu.edgekey.net.

Step 2: Capture a Trace

Step 3: Inspect the Trace

NOTE:
The DNS block follows the IP and UDP blocks. This is because DNS messages are carried in UDP segments within IP packets. 
You will see that the UDP port used by a nameserver is 53.
The DNS header starts with a Transaction ID that is used to link a request and the corresponding reply â€“ they both carry the same Transaction ID.
While DNS queries mostly server to carry the query, DNS responses often return a set of useful information.

Step 4: Details of DNS messages

1. How many bits long is the Transaction ID? 
16-bit

Based on this length, take your best guess as to how likely it is that concurrent transactions will use the same transaction ID?
1 - (2^16 - 1) / 2^16 = 0.000015

2. Which flag bit and what values signifies whether the DNS message is a query or response?
The first flag bit signifies whether the DNS message is a query (0) or response (1)

3. How many bytes long is the entire DNS header? 
There are 6 headers of 2 bytes each -> total of 12 bytes for the entire DNS header

[Use information in the bottom status line when you select parts of the packet and the bottom panel to help you work this out]

4. For the initial response, in what section are the names of the nameservers carried?
Authoritative nameservers

What is the Type of the records that carry nameserver names?
Type NS

5. Similarly, in what section are the IP addresses of the nameservers carried? 
Additional records

What is the Type of the records that carry the IP addresses?
Type A or AAAA

6. For the final response, in what section is the IP address of the domain name carried?
IP address of the domain name is carried in the Answers Section in an A or AAAA record
