A. NOTE:

dig is a flexible, command-line tool for querying remote DNS servers that replaces the older nslookup program.

B. Lab:

Step 1: Manual Name Resolution

1. dig @198.41.0.4 www.washington.edu
-> sends a request to a nameserver at given ip address for the given domain nameserver

a.edu-servers.net.	172800	IN	A	192.5.6.30

2. dig @192.5.6.30 www.washington.edu

3. dig @marge.cac.washington.edu. www.washington.edu

4. dig @140.142.9.115 www.washington.edu

;; ANSWER SECTION:
www.washington.edu.	1	IN	A	128.95.155.134

Step 4: Details of DNS messages

1. How many bits long is the Transaction ID? 
16-bit

Based on this length, take your best guess as to how likely it is that concurrent transactions will use the same transaction ID?
1 - (2^16 - 1) / 2^16 = 0.000015

2. Which flag bit and what values signifies whether the DNS message is a query or response?
The first flag bit signifies whether the DNS message is a query (0) or response (1)

3. How many bytes long is the entire DNS header? 
There are 6 headers of 2 bytes each -> total of 12 bytes for the entire DNS header

[Use information in the bottom status line when you select parts of the packet and the bottom panel to help you work this out]

4. For the initial response, in what section are the names of the nameservers carried?
Authoritative nameservers

What is the Type of the records that carry nameserver names?
Type NS

5. Similarly, in what section are the IP addresses of the nameservers carried? 
Additional records

What is the Type of the records that carry the IP addresses?
Type A (IPv4) or AAAA (IPv6)

6. For the final response, in what section is the IP address of the domain name carried?
IP address of the domain name is carried in the Answers Section in an A or AAAA record
